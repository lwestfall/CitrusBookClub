# Citrus Book Collective

We are a group of people who like to read and talk about books. We meet sometimes to discuss books we've read and to vote on which book we will read next. This application is designed to help us organize our meetings and book votes.

This repository constains the source for the website. The application is still in active development and not yet in production, however the test site is currently hosted at [test.citrusbook.club](https://test.citrusbook.club).
